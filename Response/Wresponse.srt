1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A few hours later...

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What? The Red God?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, he's making strange movements.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He's not moving by himself, is he?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No, he's using a dead body as a means of communication.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
However, the contact between the White Beard and the Red God is too dangerous!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, that's true.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
However, the Red God is not a man who can do anything but rampage.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He's not the kind of man who can decide what to do with the world by himself.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's just looking at how poorly he's moving.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
More importantly, we're in the Seventh World now.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We have to hurry to confirm Crocodile's identity.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't underestimate even a single hole.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The three great forces of the Humanity will directly put a crack in the world.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We have to protect it.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's why we're calling on the Seventh World.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wonder how many of them will show up.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
After all, they're pirates. They're selfish.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Crocodile...

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You've done something troublesome.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can't let this man, who took it, go.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Monkey D. Luffy...
