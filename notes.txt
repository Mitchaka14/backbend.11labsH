Initialization (__init__): The VTranslator class is initialized with a base folder, video input, and two tokens. It sets up an output directory.

Video Processing (process_video): This method is where the main process takes place. It's divided into several steps:

Video Download: If the video input is a YouTube URL, it downloads the video using the download_youtube_video function from the video_processing module.

Audio Extraction: It extracts the audio from the video using the extract_audio_from_video function from the video_processing module.

Vocal Separation: It separates the vocals from the audio using the separate_vocals function from the vocal_separation module.

Audio Splitting: It splits the vocal audio into chunks using the split_audio function from the audio_processing module.

Audio Chunk Processing: It processes each audio chunk (presumably doing some kind of analysis or transformation) using the process_audio_chunks function from the audio_processing module.

Transcription: It creates a transcription file from the results of the audio chunk processing.

Audio and Transcription Processing: It processes the vocal audio and the transcription file using the process_audio_and_transcription_file function from the test2 module.

Audio Overlay: It overlays the audios using the overlay_audios function from the audioVideoOverlay module.

Video Audio Replacement: It replaces the audio in the video with the new overlayed audio using the replace_video_audio function from the audioVideoOverlay module.

The main functions involved in this process are:

video_processing.download_youtube_video
video_processing.extract_audio_from_video
vocal_separation.separate_vocals
audio_processing.split_audio
audio_processing.process_audio_chunks
test2.process_audio_and_transcription_file
audioVideoOverlay.overlay_audios
audioVideoOverlay.replace_video_audio
Each function needs to be defined in its respective module for this script to work.

If you need a more detailed breakdown of what each function does, I'd need more details or the code of these functions, master.
